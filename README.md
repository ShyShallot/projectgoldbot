# MasterDB Branch
This is a WIP Branch with the goal of Multi-Server Database Storage without the need for MongoDB or any other 3rd Party Database System using JSON files, the end goal does include an API for web dashboards but that is far out, currently its just focusing on getting commands and general function converted to MaDB, once this project is done I might be made into a Node Package for easier use in other projects that might use it, MaDB could also be edited/used for Non Discord Specific Use.

# Project Gold Bot
Official Github Page for the Project Gold Bot, Master Chief. Feel free to use this bot as a base but please do not use this to impersonate the original. This Branch of the Project Gold Bot does not use UnbelievaBoat's API for point system handling but rather uses its own WIP system as the moment. When this branch merges with the master branch all UnbelievaBoat functionality will be removed and replaces with this bot's own functionality

# Main Functions
This is a custom discord bot hosted and made by for the Project Gold Discord Server: https://www.projectgold.dev/ . This is just a public repository for the bot, to use an example and as a version tracker.

# Public Use
Feel free to use this as a base, its not the greatest code in the work but it works pretty well, please note that any economy commands use UnbelievaBoat's API which is linked above.

# Platforms
The bot is built for both Windows and Linux Type Platforms and will automaticlly adjust features if need be for Linux support without having to change any code
